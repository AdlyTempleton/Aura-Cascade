aura.entry.introduction=Introduction to this Walkthrough
aura.page.introduction0=This walkthrough is intended to provide a jump start to the mechanics of this mod. It showcases only the most basic setups which can be created. The reader is encouraged to design their own setups, which will be more efficient than those contained here.

aura.entry.basicSetup=Basic Setup
aura.page.basicSetup0=The most basic power generating setup is referred to as a &14-node setup&0. A pump sends Aura upwards, which travels across the two upper nodes, falling back down and releasing &1power&0. This setup is diagrammed on the next page. Note than you must drop &1Aura Crystals&0 into this setup in order to provide the system with Aura, and place coal near the pump.
aura.page.basicSetup1=A pump and three nodes in a vertical rectangle. Substitute the pump or consumer of your choice.

aura.entry.vortexInfusion=Vortex Infusion
aura.page.vortexInfusion0=&1Vortex Infusion&0 is a method for crafting dozens of powerful items. The most basic setup involved four separate 4-node setups, replacing the Power Node with a &1Vortex Pedestal&0.

aura.entry.accumulate=Energy Storage
aura.page.accumulate0=By moving the cobblestone in or out with a sticky piston, you can store energy simply. Storage is limited by the amount of spare Aura.

aura.entry.autoOff=Power Saver
aura.page.autoOff0=A &1Monitor&0 will output a signal when next to a consumer that has finished all it's work. By placing it next to the pump, it will turn off when the job is done.

aura.entry.multiplePumps=More power
aura.page.multiplePumps0=Some &1consumers&0 require &1power&0 faster than a single pump can provide. You can easily stack multiple pumps to gain more power per second.

#Start Lexicon

aura.entry.basics=Basic Concepts
aura.page.basics0=Aura is a magical fluid, which comes from craftable &1Aura Crystals&0. You can craft different &1Aura Nodes&0, and place them in the world. Aura Nodes will connect to nearby nodes in a straight line, and transfer energy.
aura.page.basics1=Aura is not created or destroyed under most circumstances. Instead, Aura represents one part of the overall machine. Aura is used to transport and store &1Power&0, in mechanics which will be discussed later.

aura.entry.power=Power
aura.page.power0=Storing &1Power&0 with Aura is analogous to pushing a boulder up a hill. Lifting up the boulder takes a lot of power, but, as the boulder rolls back down the hill, it can be harnessed to do work. The generated Power is equal to the quantity of Aura, times the height the Aura is falling from.
aura.page.power1=Aura will naturally flow downhill but not uphill. To push Aura uphill, various &1Pumps&0 must be used. Note that pumps will push less aura if they have to push it farther - you will get the same power at any height. When Aura flows vertically downward, power will be distributed to nearby &1Consumers&0 from the lower node.

aura.entry.auraFlow=Aura Flow Mechanics
aura.page.auraFlow0=Every second, &1Aura Nodes&0 will send a percentage of their Aura to connected nodes. This percentage depends on the distance between the nodes and other connected nodes.
aura.page.auraFlow1=When two nodes are connected, both send Aura to each other. This means that the quantity of Aura in connected nodes tends toward equilibrium, under normal circumstances.
aura.page.auraFlow2=&1Aura Crystals&0 can place Aura in a node
aura.page.auraFlow3=&1Aura Nodes&0 store and transport Aura

aura.entry.interactions=Controls
aura.page.interactions0=Right click on an &1Aura Node&0 with an &1Aura Crystal&0, or toss the Aura Crystal onto the node, to give Aura and consume the crystal.<br>Right click an Aura Node with an empty hand to see the stored Aura.
aura.page.interactions1=Applying a redstone signal to a node will stop the node from sending Aura, but will allow it to receive &1Power&0. This will create a one-way flow, disrupting the natural tendency to equilibrium.

aura.entry.materials=Materials
aura.page.materials0=The &1Cascading Processor&0 is the basis of material processing. It's a &1consumer&0 block (See the consumer tab) that requires a minimum of 150 power/second. It will 'process' nearby items in various ways.
aura.page.materials1=Processing...
aura.page.materials2=First off, it will turn ores dropped nearby into two dust, if appropriate dusts exist. It can also make &1Arcane Ingots&0 of various colors by dropping a iron ingot and wool of a particular color nearby. To obtain plentiful wool use the &1Cascading Colorer&0.
aura.page.materials3=&1Arcane Gems&0 are the next tier of materials, and they come in all eight colors. They are made in &1Vortex Infusion&0 by using a diamond and 3 &1Arcane Ingots&0 of the same color.
aura.page.materials4=Oohh, Shiny!
aura.page.materials5=The final tier of materials is the &1Arcane Prism&0. It can be made by dropping &1Arcane Gems&0 of all eight colors near a &1Cascading Processor&0.
aura.page.materials6=By upgrading the &1Cascading Processor&0 with an &1Arcane Prism&0, you can make a more advanced version, the &1Prismatic Processor&0. First of all, though it uses the same power per operation as a normal Cascading Processor, it requires a minmimum of 1000 power per second. This means that it runs much faster, given adequate power.
aura.page.materials7=It has two additional operations. First, it will create three dusts per ore instead of two. It will also destroy colored wool, leaving behind the precious dye. Note that this can be a good source of materials such as ink or Lapis Lazuli.
aura.page.materials8=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger

aura.entry.monitor=Monitor
aura.page.monitor0=The &1Monitor&0 is a block that can read additional state from pumps and consumer blocks. When placed next to a pump, it will output a redstone signal when the pump runs out of fuel.<br>When placed next to a consumer, it will output a redstone signal when the consumer has no work to do (ie. when the &1Cascading Smelter&0 has no nearby smeltable items).
aura.page.monitor1=CRT back in style

aura.entry.pumps=Pumps
aura.page.pumps0=&1Pumps&0 are devices that push Aura uphill, generating &1Power&0. There are many different types of pumps, which all consume some sort of fuel in different manners, though each pump is fed fuel differently. Note that pumps can't send energy horizontally to each other, so using multiple pumps horizontally requires supplying Aura to each one individually.
aura.page.pumps1=Each pump has two properties for each type of fuel it consumes: Duration and speed. Duration is the number of seconds a pump can run off a single piece of fuel. Speed is the amount of &1Power&0 it generates each second.
aura.page.pumps2=The most basic and boring pump, the &1Burning Aura Pump&0, uses any type of fuel that can be placed in a furnace. Items will not be returned; for instance, putting in a lava bucket will not return an empty bucket. Duration: The burn duration in a furnace. Speed: 200.
aura.page.pumps3=Fire it up!

aura.entry.comparator=Comparator Interactions
aura.page.comparator0=Almost all blocks interact with the comparator. Blocks which can store &1Aura&0, primarily &1Aura Nodes&0, will output a signal based off of their stored Aura. 10 stored Aura produces a signal of 1, 100 stored Aura produces a signal of 2, and so on. Cascading blocks output signal based on their progress divided by their required progress.

aura.entry.black=Black Aura
aura.page.black0=Black Aura has a few special properties. First, it has a weight of zero: It can't be pumped uphill, and generates no power when flowing downhill. It can't flow horizontally, only vertically. Most importantly, it can be created or destroyed by an &1Aura Manipulator&0
aura.page.black1=Guys, it triggers &1Aura Capacitors&0. It's useful, ok?

aura.entry.red=Red Aura
aura.page.red0=When TNT is detonated near an &1Aura Node&0 containing &4Red Aura&0, it will absorb the explosion and it will push Red Aura uphill, acting like a pump. Each TNT block generates 200,000 power.
aura.page.red1=Boom.

aura.entry.orange=Orange Aura
aura.page.orange0=&6Orange Aura&0 shares the properties of Black Aura, except that it can only move horizontally and can't move vertically. When Orange Aura moves, it induces a current in nearby &1Aura Nodes&0, causing Aura to flow in the same direction.
aura.page.orange1=Just go with the flow

aura.entry.yellow=Yellow Aura
aura.page.yellow0=&eYellow Aura&0 provides a x2 ascent boost, meaning that it takes half of the energy to pump up, while producing the normal amount of power falling down. However, Yellow Aura rapidly breaks down in &1Aura Nodes&0.
aura.page.yellow1=Aaaaand, it's gone.

aura.entry.green=Green Aura
aura.page.green0=&2Green Aura's&0 weight changes throughout the day. During daytime, it weights 2x as much as normal, meaning it takes more energy to pump up and releases more energy going down. At night, however, it weights only half as much as normal.
aura.page.green1=Photosynthesis FTW

aura.entry.blue=Blue Aura
aura.page.blue0=&1Blue Aura&0 provides a massive x4 ascent boost, meaning that it takes a fourth of the energy to pump up, while producing the normal amount of power falling down, but only when it's raining. At other times, it has a detrimental x0.5 ascent boost.
aura.page.blue1=Rain: useful, but still annoying

aura.entry.violet=Violet Aura
aura.page.violet0=&5Violet Aura&0 will continuously grow when placed in an &1Aura Node&0. This growth is logarithmic (It goes quicker when less Violet aura is in a single node), and caps out at 2,500 Violet Aura per node. Spreading Violet Aura among many nodes will increase growth. However, if less than 25 Violet Aura remains in a node, it will dissipate. More than 2600 Violet Aura in a node will also cause all the aura to dissipate.
aura.page.violet1=IT'S SPREADING

aura.entry.alternating=Alternating Pumps
aura.page.alternating0=A new technique will make your pumps much more efficient, at a price. &1Alternating Pumps&0 produce much more power than their mundane counterparts. However, their output is not constant. It varies sinusoidally (Like a wave) over an eight minute period.
aura.page.alternating2=As above, so below
aura.page.alternating3=They come in all varieties

aura.entry.flux=Fluxing Node
aura.page.flux0=The &1Fluxing Node&0 will convert power from aura falling into it into Redstone Flux. It does this by creating an &1Aura Bubble&0. This bubble will surround and power adjacent power-consuming blocks, and blocks adjacent to those ones, and so on, providing power to all of them.
aura.page.flux1=This Aura Bubble has a limit, however. It will only contain a total of 4 power-consuming blocks. This means that the Fluxing Node won't provide power to a large network. It also won't connect to blocks such as pipes or wireless energy transport mechanisms, like tesseracts.
aura.page.flux2=The bullet, guys. I bit it. Copied some stuff, too.

aura.entry.capacitor=Aura Capacitor
aura.page.capacitor0=The &1Aura Capacitor&0, unlike other &1Aura Nodes&0, will not normally send energy. Instead, the capacitor has a threshold, which can be toggled with a shift-right click. The capacitor will build up aura until it exceeds it's threshold, at which point it will totally discharge itself, remaining unable to receive aura for a few seconds.
aura.page.capacitor1=OMG It stores things multiblock plz

aura.entry.conserve=Conserving Aura Node
aura.page.conserve0=The &1Conserving Aura Node&0 functions much like a regular &1Aura Node&0, with one caveat: it will not send aura downhill. This can be used in conjunction with &4Red Aura&0, or to achieve compact builds.
aura.page.conserve1=No going back

aura.entry.manipulator=Aura Manipulator
aura.page.manipulator0=The &1Aura Manipulator&0 comes in two colors: Orange and Black. When not given a redstone signal, it will accept only aura of it's chosen color, and destroy it. When powered by redstone, it will rapidly generate extremely large amounts of it's chosen color of aura.
aura.page.manipulator1=Black Aura Manipulator
aura.page.manipulator2=Orange Aura Manipulator

aura.entry.pumpFall=Momentum Pump
aura.page.pumpFall0=The &1Momentum Pump&0 is a pump that derives energy from the falling of mobs. When mobs fall near the pump, they will provide a duration of 2 seconds for every block the mob fell, and a speed of 500.
aura.page.pumpFall1=&o*Leg breaking noises*&r

aura.entry.pumpLight=Illumination Pump
aura.page.pumpLight0=The &1Illumination Pump&0 is a pump that derives energy from nearby light sources. It will consume adjacent glowstone and torches, producing a speed of 750 power/s. The duration is 3 minutes for glowstone and 30 seconds for a torch.
aura.page.pumpLight1=How enlightening

aura.entry.pumpRedstone=Redstone Pump
aura.page.pumpRedstone0=The &1Redstone Pump&0 is a pump that derives energy from nearby redstone. When a redstone wire is connected and powered, the pump will consume the redstone wire, generating a power of 1500 and a duration of 10 seconds for the first wire. It will eat a line of redstone up to 15 blocks long, generating a 40% greater duration for subsequent redstone.
aura.page.pumpRedstone1=Red Power

aura.entry.pumpProjectile=Projectile Pump
aura.page.pumpProjectile0=The &1Projectile Pump&0 will absorb certain projectiles thrown into it, generating power. Snowballs produce a duration of 10s and a speed of 500. Eggs produce a duration of 90s and a speed of 500. Arrows produce a duration of 20 and a speed of 1000.
aura.page.pumpProjectile1=PEW PEW PEW

#Consumers

aura.entry.consumers=Consumers
aura.page.consumers0=&1Consumers&0 are blocks which use &1Power&0 to accomplish some task. When Aura flows from uphill to downhill, the downhill node will automatically distribute. All consumer blocks experience extreme diminishing returns: It takes 3x the energy for 2x the speed, 7x energy for 3x speed, and 15x energy for 4x speed.

aura.entry.crafting=Vortex Infusion
aura.page.crafting0=Vortex Infusion is a process for creating many higher-level items. First, place a &1Vortex Controller&0 down, and place four &1Vortex Pedestals&0 adjacent to it. Following a recipe, right-click to place the correct items on all four pedestals.
aura.page.crafting1=Now, you need to supply the pedestals with &1Power&0. Each pedestal acts like an &1Aura Node&0, unlike most consumer blocks. Each recipe needs different amounts of power per pedestal. Some recipies require a specific color of Aura to be used; These requirements can vary based on the item in the pedestal.
aura.page.crafting2=Vortex Controller

aura.entry.dye=Cascading Colorer
aura.page.dye0=The &1Cascading Colorer&0 is designed to ensure an easy supply of wool. It will, when given an extremely small amount of power, both replenish the wool on nearby sheep and dye them into a random color.
aura.page.dye1=&cR&4A&6I&eN&aB&2O&1W&5S&d!&0

aura.entry.angel=Cascading Synthesizer
aura.page.angel0=This block will consume power to synthesize &1Angel's Steel&0, an extremely powerful material. It runs at a minimum speed of 10000 power/s.
aura.page.angel1=And out of the thin air...

aura.entry.furnace=Cascading Smelter
aura.page.furnace0=The &1Cascading Smelter&0 will smelt nearby items when powered. Like most consumers, it will also keep nearby items from despawning. The smelter has a minimum power requirement of 190 power/second.
aura.page.furnace1=That's so hot!

aura.entry.fish=Cascading Fisher
aura.page.fish0=The &1Cascading Fisher&0 will fish for you for a small amount of power. Just place the Cascading Fisher over a 3x3 pool of water, power it, and watch the fish pour in!
aura.page.fish1=Nobody likes fishing

aura.entry.loot=Cascading Looter
aura.page.loot0=The &1Cascading Looter&0 will summon the loot from dungeon chests. The looter has a minimum power requirement of 5000 power/second.
aura.page.loot1=Still no rupees

aura.entry.mob=Cascading Spawner
aura.page.mob0=The &1Cascading Spawner&0 will summon mobs directly on top of it. The mobs summoned will represent the full range of mobs which can spawn in a location. The spawner has a minimum power requirement of 190 power/second.
aura.page.mob1=How many mobs? All of them.

aura.entry.plant=Cascading Grower
aura.page.plant0=The &1Cascading Grower&0 will rapidly grow plants directly on top of it. The plant should be placed two blocks above the Cascading Grower, with a block of dirt in the middle. The grower has a minimum power requirement of 150 power/second.
aura.page.plant1=Who needs fertilizer?

aura.entry.books=Book Storage
aura.page.books0=Books are an end-game method of storing and accessing items. Items are stored in different &1Storage Books&0. To access the Storage Books, place them in a vanilla bookshelf by right-clicking. Storage books hold items, and different types can hold different quantities or amounts of items, or can accept only certain types of items.
aura.page.books1=A &1Bookshelf Coordinator&0 will allow you to access any connected bookshelves. To connect a storage-book-containing bookshelf, two requirements must be met: There must be a connection made of bookshelves, either empty or full. There must also be a clear line-of-sight between the coordinator and the bookshelf storing items.
aura.page.books2=The coordinator requires power from an adjacent node. It will consume 5 power per bookshelf for small systems. Larger quantities of bookshelves make it less efficient: The cost will increase by 5% for each added bookshelf.
aura.page.books3=The brain of the storage system
aura.page.books4=Stores 27 stacks
aura.page.books5=Dense Storage Books can store tons of items, but only a few types of items. &1Dense Storage Books&0 store 8 stacks of 1,000 items, &1Very Dense Storage Books&0 store 4 stacks of 5,000 items, &1Super Dense Storage Books&0 store 2 stacks of 25,000 items, and finally, &1Extremely Dense Storage Books&0 store 1 stack of 1,000,000 items.
aura.page.books6=Dense Storage Book
aura.page.books7=Very Dense Storage Book
aura.page.books8=Super Dense Storage Book
aura.page.books9=Extremely Dense Storage Book
aura.page.books10=Light Storage Books can store many types of items, but only a few items per stack. The &1Light Storage Books&0 store 100 stacks of 32 items, &1Very Light Storage Books&0 store 150 stacks of 16 items, &1Super Light Storage Books&0 store 1,000 stacks of 4 items, and &1Extremely Light Storage Books&0 store 10,000 stacks of 1 item.
